Create a variable.js file and declare variables and assign string, boolean, undefined and null data types

let name = "ruth" //string
let age = 23 //number
let married  = true //boolean
let pregnant = null //object
let children  //undefined

Create datatypes.js file and use the JavaScript typeof operator to check different data types. Check the data type of each variable

console.log (typeof "ruth")
console.log (typeof 23)
console.log(typeof true)
console.log(typeof null)
console.log(typeof undefined)


Declare four variables without assigning values
let name 
let age 
let married 
let pregnant
let children  

Declare four variables with assigned values

let name = "ruth" //string
let age = 23 //number
let married  = true //boolean
let pregnant = null //object



let myAge = 23
let yourAge = 25

console.log (`I am ${myAge} year old \n you are ${yourAge} year old`)

/*Declare variables to store your first name, last name, marital status, country and age in a single line
*/
let firstName = "Ruth"
let lastName = "Okeniyi"
let maritalStatus = "married"
let country  = "Germany"
let age = 23
let space =" "
let fullName = firstName + space + lastName + space + 'is' + space + age + space + 'and' + space + maritalStatus + space + 'in' + space + country + space

console.log (fullName)
